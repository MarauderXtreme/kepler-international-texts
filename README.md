Kepler International Texts
==========================

These are the published texts that can be found under [Kepler International](http://kepler.international/ "Kepler International").

Purpose
-------

I decided to make this repo so that you guys can help me and make the content of my site better. From time to time I am writing my texts late in the evening. No wonder that there are some errors and typos. Because I have written the text often I won't notice these minor flaws even after reading it a second time. This is where you come in. If you find something let me know.

HOW-TO
------

When you have found some mistake report an issue or even better make a pull request. I will review the changes and include them into my site.

Contributions
-------------

Because my site has a WYSIWYG Editor all the files are written in HTML. Please make sure you correct the errors in the HTML style. Don't worry this is mostly just basic HTML. I provide a list of allowed tags later.

i18n
----

You will see that some files have an *.de.html or an *.en.html ending. This is content that is intended to be translated. If you can't find the corresponding file in the other language feel free to provide a translation. The only language I want to support are German and English so I will only accept thoise both languages.

Rewards
-------

**None**. You just waste your time so that I don't have to maintain the text. Hahaha Fool!
**Kidding**. At least until now I don't how to show who has contributed to the site or what. I will think of this later if I see that this repo serves it purpose. Maybe I will make a site on my wbesite with an overview of contributors.

Future
------

Maybe later I will accept new topics via this repo but for now it is just for correcting my mistakes.
