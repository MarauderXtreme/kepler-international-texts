<h2>Kepler is Root</h2>
<p>Recently I created my own "Root-Certificate". Roughly I signed a certificate by myself and trusted other certificates against it. Sounded more exciting than it was, didn't it?</p>
<h2>Why such an effort? Why no real oder self-signed one?</h2>
<ol>
	<li>I have other subdomains so that I would need a multi-domain or wildcard-certificate. At this time I can't afford it.</li>
	<li>It was a nice exercise. I learned a bit about certification and SSL.</li>
	<li>It looks more beautifull. Since the certificate is installed there is no need for a security exception.</li>
	<li>Maybe my friends need a certificate where distrtibuting it isn't hard.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Do I need it?</h2>
<p><strong>Of course</strong>, it is a <strong>Must-Have</strong>. Install it in every Browser you get your hands on. As soon as my certificate reaches half of the world all major browser have to accept me. <strong>The world will be mine</strong>.</p>
<p>Now back to reality and away from megalomania. At first the certificate is only useful if you visit a site that is trusted against my root. At this time it is only kepler.international and its subdomains. For all users of my <a href="https://git.kepler.international" target="_blank">Git</a> and possible a later mail server this certificate could be convenient. Furthermore for all people with an account on Kepler International the installation is useful. On occasion I will switch the backend to SSL.</p>
<h2>So, where do I find this root thingy?</h2>
<p><a href="http://cert.kepler.international" target="_blank">Here! Here! Here! Click me!!! I am a link.</a> You find also a link in the footer of the site.</p>
<p>On this site you will find an overview how-to install a certificate. At this time it is without pictures. I hope this is no problem but if, I don't give a fork.</p>
