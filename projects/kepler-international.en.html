<h2>General</h2>
<p>This is my site. My precious. <a href="http://isthissitebuiltwithdrupal.com/http://kepler.international" target="_blank">It is built with Drupal</a>, for me the number one CMS for a scalable Website.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This site is mostly for shenanigans. This is my test area for drupal and web develoment and possibly a place for feedback from you. For me it is easier to show my results here because nowadays almost everyone has access to the internet and a browser.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Besides its experimental charakter this side will serve as information site. You will find all my projects and their results here. If it is convenient I will write matching Tutorials and How-Tos. As soon as I would like I start to write Reviews to some topics. The Blog will have a special state. Depending on my mood I will publish entries to topics I find intertesting.</p>
<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>I will do my very best on testing and explaining all the tutorials. Although I can't ensure that there aren't any little mistakes. So use them on your own risk. I suggest using them as guideline or reference. I don't think that I will write about crittical things that could cause severe damage but I don't know. If you notice a mistake and have some time please notify me about it. I try to correct it as fast as possible.</p>
